# CDE-Periormer: CDE-Enhanced Periodic Transformer for irregularly sampled time series

This repository contains the code and datasets for the paper "CDE-Periormer: CDE-Enhanced Periodic Transformer for irregularly sampled time series". In this paper, we propose a new method for time series prediction considering different periodic patterns under different sampling rate of raw series.

We design CDE-Periormer structure to handle irregular sampling rate and periodic patterns. The overall architecture can be found on the following figure.
